# pyairhealth

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

The goal of this project is to develop a Python package that can conduct
public health assessments of air quality, similar to as the U.S. EPA’s
U.S. EPA’s [Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program -
Community Edition (BenMAP-CE)](https://www.epa.gov/benmap).

BenMAP-CE is a tool that calculates the public health benefits resulting
from changes in air quality, such as premature death, lung cancer, and
hospitalization. It is a de facto standard and is developed and updated
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Although it is an excellent
tool, its graphical user interface is not ideal for conducting public
health assessments programmatically.

This package uses a part of BenMAP-CE’s internal database and allows you
to calculate the impact of air quality on public health and its economic
value using Python. It will also provide a summary of atmospheric
science, public health, and economics in the context of assessing the
public health effect of air quality.
