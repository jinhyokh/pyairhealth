It is a de facto standard and is developed and updated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Although it is an excellent tool, its graphical user interface is not ideal for conducting public health assessments programmatically.\n",

It will also provide a summary of atmospheric science, public health, and economics in the context of assessing the public health effect of air  quality."
